## EZL

The core mission of the EZL is to build a global, multi-platform opportunity for any player at any level of skill to have a place to compete. We also want to provide a place for any player of any age to begin playing, improve and grow, while being a part of the EZL as a whole.

## Code Example

Show what the library does as concisely as possible, developers should be able to figure out **how** your project solves their problem by looking at the code example. Make sure the API you are showing off is obvious, and that your code is short and concise.

## Motivation

We envision to take eSports to a traditional sports level by changing the perception of gaming so it is one day respected, desired and worked for not only by gamers but also by parents. To provide an opportunity for everyone to create and improve a resume that they will use not only to rise in the league itself but it can be used outside the league. We hope to one day have each and every position paid and have intern positions where you can learn, improve your resume and slowly rise to other positions. We also wish to provide an opportunity for thise willing to learn any of the tasks in the league, so not just to play, but also to code, market, manage and more.  We also want to provide the opportunity to orphans and homeless people throughout the world to have access to equipment so they can be a part of the EZL family and much more.
